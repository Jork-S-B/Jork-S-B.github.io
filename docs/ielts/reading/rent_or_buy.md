Is it better to rent or buy?

    租房还是买房：孰优孰劣？

Much depends on long-term interest rates.

    抉择关键，取决于长期利率走势。

“That our people should live in their own homes is a sentiment deep in the heart of our race and of American life,” said President Herbert Hoover, perhaps the most important advocate of mass homeownership in the country’s history, in 1931. “They never sing songs about a pile of rent receipts.”

    “民众拥有自住房，是深植于美利坚民族与生活方式之中的情感，”1931年，时任总统赫伯特·胡佛（Herbert Hoover）如此感慨。作为美国历史上推动大众置业最力的倡导者之一，他直言不讳地说道：“没人会为那一叠叠租金收据谱写赞歌。”（这句话大家可以留言翻译的更接地气）

But a ballad about the rental market is overdue. When rich-world interest rates began to surge in 2022, renting became a better deal than buying. House prices have since stagnated or slumped in many places, and rates are falling. Even so, there is reason to think that the winning streak for renters will continue.

    然而，一首献给租房市场的“民谣”早已姗姗来迟。自2022年发达国家利率开始飙升以来，租房便显现出比买房更高的性价比。此后，全球多地房价陷入停滞甚至下挫，即便近期利率有所回落，也有理由相信，租房者的“连胜势头”仍将延续。

According to Zillow, an American property website, the monthly cost of buying and keeping a home—including taxes, insurance, modest maintenance and a 20% down payment—was lower than renting from 2015 to 2021, an era of ultra-low interest rates. Since then, however, the picture has flipped. Today a new buyer pays about $400 more per month. In several of America’s largest cities, the gap runs into thousands of dollars a month.

    据美国房产门户网站Zillow的数据，在2015至2021年的超低利率时代，购房并持有房屋的月均成本（含税费、保险、常规维护及20%首付的资金成本）曾低于租房。但此后，攻守之势逆转：如今新置业者每月的平均支出比租房高出约400美元；在部分美国一线城市，这一缺口更是高达数千美元。

This is not just an American phenomenon. According to CBRE, a global real-estate firm, there is no precinct in Australia where buying an apartment is cheaper than renting one. Rathbones, a British wealth-management firm, estimates that rental yields—the income landlords earn relative to a property’s price—are around 5%, only slightly above the 4.4% rate on five-year fixed mortgages. Given that landlords also face steep maintenance and tax bills, this suggests tenants are getting a good deal.

    这并非美国独有的现象。全球地产服务商世邦魏理仕（CBRE）指出，在澳大利亚任何区域，购买公寓的持有成本都超过了租金。英国财富管理公司Rathbones估算，目前的租金收益率（即年租金相对于房价的比例）约为5%，仅略高于4.4%的五年期固定房贷利率。考虑到房东还需支付不菲的维护和税务账单，这意味着租户实际上占了便宜。

Renters often fear they are throwing money away by paying landlords, while buyers build equity. But property is not the only investment available. Arthur Cox of the University of Northern Iowa finds that even during 1984–2013—a period of rising house prices and sharply falling mortgage rates—homeownership was not always the superior financial choice. In three of the six U.S. metropolitan areas he studied, renting and investing the would-be mortgage payments in stocks and corporate bonds yielded higher returns over time.

    租房者常担心付给房东的钱是“打水漂”，而购房则是在积累资产净值。然而，房产并非唯一的投资篮子。北爱荷华大学的亚瑟·考克斯（Arthur Cox）研究发现，即便在1984至2013年——一个房价攀升、房贷利率大幅下行的置业黄金期——买房也未必总是最优的财务决策。在他研究的六个美国大都会区中，有三个地区的数据显示：若选择租房，并将原本计划用于还贷的差额资金投入股市或公司债，长期的复利回报反而更胜一筹。

True, renters have lost ground in some markets. In Hong Kong, rental yields have risen from below 2.5% four years ago to 3.5% today. This shift stems from a sharp fall in house prices, which have dropped by a third in real terms since 2021.

    诚然，在某些市场，租房的性价比优势正在被蚕食。以香港为例，租金收益率已从四年前的不足2.5%攀升至如今的3.5%。这一变化的主因是房价的剧烈缩水——自2021年以来，香港的实际房价已累计下挫了三分之一。

But Hong Kong’s mortgages differ from those elsewhere in the rich world. Most borrowers there hold floating-rate loans tied to the Federal Reserve’s short-term policy rates. In contrast, mortgages in most advanced economies are linked to longer-term rates—which have barely budged. Despite recent rate cuts, five- and ten-year government bond yields remain near levels seen three years ago. In America, 30-year mortgage rates still hover above 6%, more than double their pandemic-era lows. Shorter-term loans are available, but they expose buyers to the risk of resurgent inflation—and thus higher rates.

    但香港的房贷逻辑与世界其他发达经济体大相径庭：当地多数贷款为浮动利率，直接挂钩美联储的短期政策利率。相比之下，多数发达国家的房贷利率锚定的是长期利率——而后者近期几乎纹丝不动。尽管多国央行近期启动降息，但五年期和十年期国债收益率仍维持在三年前的高位。在美国，30年期房贷利率依然徘徊在6%以上，是疫情期间历史低点的两倍有余。虽然购房者可以选择短期贷款，但这将使其直接暴露在通胀反弹、利率回升的风险之下。

Picking a likely victor in the ongoing battle between tenancy and ownership therefore hinges on one’s view of long-term interest rates. Your columnist suspects they will remain stubbornly high. Concerns over public debt and persistent inflationary pressures show no sign of abating.

    因此，在这场“租买博弈”中谁能胜出，完全取决于对长期利率走势的研判。本专栏作者怀疑，长期利率将保持“顽固的高位”。毕竟，对公共债务的担忧与持续的通胀压力目前尚无消退迹象。

Moreover, renter-friendly regulation has swept the West in recent years. Britain’s Renters’ Rights Act makes evictions harder and empowers tenants to challenge rent hikes through tribunals. Many American cities have frozen regulated rents—a move New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, plans to implement. Such rules are terrible news for would-be property investors and tilt the balance further toward tenants.

    此外，近年来“亲租户”的监管浪潮正席卷西方。英国的《租户权利法案》加大了房东驱逐租客的难度，并赋予租客通过仲裁庭挑战加租的权利。许多美国城市已冻结了受管制房屋的租金，纽约新任市长佐赫兰·马姆丹尼（Zohran Mamdani）也计划跟进。这些规则对潜在的房产投资者而言无疑是噩耗，却让天平进一步向租户倾斜。

Buyers have reasons to own that transcend cold financial logic. Many feel the same emotional pull that inspired Hoover nearly a century ago. Others seek long-term security or simply cannot find suitable rentals—especially large, single-family homes. But for the cool-headed resident weighing the numbers alone, the verdict is clear: unless house prices plunge, long-term rates collapse, or rents surge persistently, renting remains the smarter choice.

    购房者自有超越冷冰冰财务逻辑的理由：有人追求胡佛在一个世纪前描述的那种情感归属；有人渴求长期的居住安全感；还有人纯粹是因为在租赁市场找不到合适的房源——尤其是宽敞的独栋住宅。然而，对于那些唯数据论的理智居民来说，结论显而易见：除非房价崩盘、长期利率骤降或租金持续飙升，否则，租房依然是更精明的选择。
