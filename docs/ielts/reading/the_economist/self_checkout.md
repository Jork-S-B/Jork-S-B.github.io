The parable of the supermarket self-checkout

How imperfect technologies spread.

Imagine an invention that is worse at what it does than humans, 
threatens jobs and increases the potential for crime.

??? note "翻译&笔记"

    想象一项发明，它比人类做事更差劲，不仅威胁就业，还增加了犯罪的可能性。

You might think it would go nowhere fast.

In fact, the supermarket self-checkout machine is a _parable_ of **technology adoption** - how
something can spread despite imperfections - and also one of management: 
how real-world _trade-offs_ affect rates of change.

to pick items from the shelves for themselves rather than asking a clerk to _fetch_ them.

Even now, they bring their own very specific irritations-age-verification checks to buy alcohol even though you remember 
using faxes; a ten-step process to confirm that the yellow, **waxy citrus fruit** you put in your basket is a lemon.

??? note "翻译&笔记"

    即便是现在，自助结账机也有它们非常具体的烦人之处一买酒时要进行年龄验证，尽管你是记得如何使用传真机的老人；
    要经过十个步骤才能确认你放进篮子里的那颗黄色、**蜡质柑橘类水果**是柠檬。

A cashier at an assisted lane can handle these **thorny** problems without having to think;
skilled ones can also scan items much faster than customers.

    人工通道的收银员无需思考就能处理这些棘手问题，熟练的收银员扫描商品的速度也比顾客快得多。

Why then are self-service machines a _fixture_ in most retailers?

??? note "翻译&笔记"

    那么为什么自助服务机成为大多数零售商的*固定配置*呢？

The big reason is economic: the ratio of staff to customers is much lower for self-checkout machines
than it is on assisted lanes.

主要原因是经济方面的：自助结账机与人工通道相比，员工与顾客的比例要低得多。
