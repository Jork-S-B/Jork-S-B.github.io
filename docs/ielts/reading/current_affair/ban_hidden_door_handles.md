China is banning hidden door handles that can be pretty hard to open on all new electric vehicles beginning next year.

A world first ban, because China says in multiple crashes, it's suspected that power failed, doors did not open,
people couldn't get out.

New car models **applying for Chinese approval** must **meet** these new door handle rules by January 1st, 2027.

    中国将从明年开始，禁止在所有新款电动汽车上使用那些隐藏式、而且很难打开的车门把手。
    
    这是全世界首例相关禁令，因为中国方面表示，在多起事故中，怀疑发生了断电，导致车门无法打开，人员无法逃生。
    
    所有申请在中国获得审批的新车型，必须在2027年1月1日之前**符合**这些新的车门把手规定。
    
    apply for someone's approval：寻求某人的同意、认可  
    apply：v.申请；运用  
    approval：n.批准，许可
    
    符合，遵守_同义替换  
    * meet：v.结识；会晤；相符，符合  
    * in accord with：Salary will be in accord with qualifications, beginning at a minimum of $2,000 per month.  
    * conform to  
    * comply with  

That means real mechanical door releases, inside, outside, with no power required.

For all the cars on the road already with hidden handles, there's no **indication** yet that they would need to change.

This affects millions of cars from Tesla to **tons of** Chinese brands like Xiaomi and BYD that have been
inspired by Tesla's door design.

    这意味着车门必须配备真正的机械式开门装置，无论是车内还是车外，且不依赖电力即可打开。
    
    对于目前道路上已经配备隐藏式把手的车辆，暂时还没有**迹象**表明它们需要进行改造。
    
    这一规定将影响**数百万**辆汽车，从特斯拉到大量受特斯拉车门设计启发的中国品牌，例如小米和比亚迪。

Chinese media have also reported that around 60% of new Chinese EVs use the hidden door handles.

China isn't just the world's largest car market, it's becoming the rule setter for the entire world.

What China bans, more countries may follow.

    中国媒体还报道称，大约60%的中国新款电动车使用的是隐藏式车门把手。
    
    中国不仅是世界上最大的汽车市场，它正在成为全球规则的制定者。
    
    可能会有更多国家跟进中国的相关禁令。


## 📌 summary

??? note "原版"

    The report illustrates that China is setting a regulation about forbid hidden door handles on new electric vehicles by 2027.
    
    This design inspired by Tesla（碎片化的短语属于是）, is suspected that the car door meight not have been opened for escape due to 
    power failure in accidents.
    
    But there's no related rules for those millions of cars that have already used hidden door handles.
    
    As the world's largest car market, this world's first ban is believed to be followed by other countries 
    as appropriate（视情况而定）.

    1.准确转述事实：总结必须严格基于原文信息，尤其是数据、排名等关键事实，切忌主观增减（如“as appropriate”）或误读。  
    2.使用专业词汇：在法规语境下，使用 ban (禁止)、comply with (遵守)、regulation (法规)、retroactively (追溯地) 等词会更准确。

The report _outlines_ that China is setting a world-first regulation to ban hidden door handles on new electric vehicles (EVs), 
**with full compliance required** by 2027. This design, popularized by Tesla, is **under scrutiny** because in crashes 
where power fails, the doors may not open, potentially trapping occupants.

However, the new rule does not apply _retroactively_ to the millions of cars already on the road with such handles. 
As the world's largest car market, China's _pioneering_ ban is likely to influence regulations in other countries.
