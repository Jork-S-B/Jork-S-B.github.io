# EFFECTS OF NOISE

In general, it is _plausible_ to suppose that we should prefer peace and quiet to noise. And
yet most of us have had the experience of having to adjust to sleeping in the mountains or
the countryside because it was initially 'too quiet', an experience that suggests that
humans are capable of adapting to a wide range of noise levels. Research supports this
view. For example, Glass and Singer (1972) exposed people to short bursts of very loud
noise and then measured their ability to work out problems and their physiological
reactions to the noise. The noise was quite disruptive at first, but after about four minutes
the subjects were doing just as well on their tasks as control subjects who were not exposed
to noise. Their **physiological arousal** also declined quickly to the same levels as those of
the control subjects.

    arousal：n.唤起；兴奋；觉醒；  
    physiological arousal：生理兴奋，指身体对于外界刺激的生理反应，如心率加快、血压升高、呼吸加深等。

But there are limits to adaptation and loud noise becomes more troublesome if the person
is required to concentrate on more than one task. For example, high noise levels interfered
with the performance of subjects who were required to monitor three dials at a time, a
task not unlike that of an aeroplane pilot or an air-traffic controller (Broad bent, 1957).
Similarly, noise did not affect a subject's ability to track a moving line with a steering
wheel, but it did _interfere_ with the subject's ability to repeat numbers while tracking
(Finkelman and Glass, 1970).

Probably the most significant finding from research on noise is that its predictability is
more important than how loud it is. We are much more able to 'tune out' chronic
background noise, even if it is quite loud, than to work under circumstances with
unexpected intrusions of noise. In the Glass and Singer study, in which subjects were
exposed to bursts of noise as they worked on a task, some subjects heard loud bursts and
others heard soft bursts. For some subjects, the bursts were spaced exactly one minute
apart (predictable noise); others heard the same amount of noise overall, but the bursts
occurred at random intervals (unpredictable noise). Subjects reported finding the
predictable and unpredictable noise equally annoying, and all subjects performed at about
the same level during the noise portion of the experiment. But the different noise
conditions had quite different after-effects when the subjects were required to _proofread_
written material under conditions of no noise. As shown in Table 1 the unpredictable
noise produced more errors in the later proofreading task than predictable noise; and soft,
unpredictable noise actually produced slightly more errors on this task than the loud,
predictable noise.

|:-----------|:------------------------|:----------------------|:------------|
| Loud noise | 40.1                    | 31.8                  | 35.9        |
| Soft noise | 36.7                    | 27.4                  | 32.1        |
| Average    | 38.4                    | 29.6                  |             |

Apparently, unpredictable noise produces more fatigue than predictable noise, but it takes 
a while for this fatigue to take its toll on performance. 

Predictability is not the only variable that reduces or eliminates the negative effects of 
noise. Another is control. If the individual knows that he or she can control the noise, this 
seems to eliminate both its negative effects at the time and its after-effects. This is true even 
if the individual never actually exercises his or her option to turn the noise off (Glass and 
Singer, 1972). Just the knowledge that one has control is sufficient. 

The studies discussed so far exposed people to noise for only short periods and only 
transient effects were studied. But the major worry about noisy environments is that living 
day after day with chronic noise may produce serious, lasting effects. One study, suggesting 
that this worry is a realistic one, compared elementary school pupils who attended schools 
near Los Angeles's busiest airport with students who attended schools in quiet 
neighbourhoods (Cohen et al., 1980). It was found that children from the noisy schools 
had higher blood pressure and were more easily distracted than those who attended the 
quiet schools. Moreover, there was no evidence of adaptability to the noise. In fact, the 
longer the children had attended the noisy schools, the more distractible they became. The 
effects also seem to be long lasting. A follow-up study showed that children who were 
moved to less noisy classrooms still showed greater distractibility one year later than 
students who had always been in the quiet schools (Cohen et al, 1981 ). It should be noted 
that the two groups of children had been carefully matched by the investigators so that 
they were comparable in age, ethnicity, race, and social class.
