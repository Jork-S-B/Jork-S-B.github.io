# Preface（序言） to 'How the other half thinks: Adventures in mathematical reasoning'

## A

Occasionally, in some difficult _musical compositions_, there are beautiful, but easy
parts-parts so simple a beginner could play them. So it is with mathematics as
well. There are some discoveries in advanced mathematics that do not depend on
specialized knowledge, not even on algebra,geometry,or trigonometry. Instead
they may involve, at most, a little _arithmetic_, such as 'the sum of two odd numbers
is even', and common sense. Each of the eight chapters in this book illustrates this
phenomenon. Anyone can understand every step in the reasoning.

The thinking in each chapter uses at most only elementary arithmetic, and
sometimes not even that. _Thus all readers will have the chance to participate in a
mathematical experience, to appreciate the beauty of mathematics_, and to become
familiar with its logical, yet _intuitive_, style of thinking.

## B

One of my purposes in writing this book is to give readers who haven't had the
opportunity to see and enjoy real mathematics the chance to appreciate the
mathematical way of thinking.I want to reveal not only some of the fascinating
discoveries,but,more importantly,the reasoning behind them.

In that respect,this book differs from most books on mathematics written for the
general public.Some present the lives of colorful mathematicians.Others describe
important applications of mathematics. _Yet others go into mathematical procedures,
but assume that the reader** is adept in **using algebra._

## C

I hope this book will help bridge that _notorious_ gap that separates the two cultures:
the humanities and the sciences,or should I say the right brain (intuitive)and the
left brain (analytical,numerical).As the chapters will illustrate,mathematics is not
restricted to the analytical and numerical;intuition plays a significant role._**The
alleged gap** can be narrowed or completely overcome by anyone,**in part because**
each of us is far from using the full capacity of either side of the brain_.To illustrate
our human potential,I _cite_ a structural engineer who is an artist,an electrical
engineer who is an opera singer,an opera singer who published mathematical
research,and a mathematician who publishes short stories.

## D

_Other scientists have written books to explain their fields to non-scientists, but have
necessarily had to _omit_ the mathematics, although it provides the foundation of their
theories._ The reader must remain a tantalized spectator rather than an involved
participant, since the appropriate language for describing the details in much of
science is mathematics, whether the subject is expanding universe, subatomic
particles, or chromosomes. Though the broad outline of a scientific theory can be
_sketched_ intuitively, when a part of the physical universe is finally understood, its
description often looks like a page in a mathematics text.

    omit：v.省略，忽略

    sketch：v.素描；简述

## E

_Still, the non-mathematical reader can go far in understanding mathematical
reasoning._ This book presents the details that illustrate the mathematical style
of thinking, which involves _sustained_, step-by-step analysis, experiments, and
insights. You will turn these pages much more slowly than when reading a novel
or a newspaper. It may help to have a pencil and paper ready to check claims and
**carry out** experiments.

    然而，非数学读者在理解数学推理方面可以走得更远。

    reasoning：n.v.推理；以理相劝

    sustain：v.维持，持续

    carry out experiments：进行实验

## F

As I wrote, I kept in mind two types of readers: those who enjoyed mathematics
until they were **turned off by** an unpleasant episode, usually around fifth grade, and
mathematics _aficionados_, who will find much that is new throughout the book.

    turn off by：使不感兴趣，使厌烦；关闭电器

    episode：n.经历，事件；插曲

    aficionado：n.狂热爱好者，粉丝

This book also serves readers who simply want to sharpen their analytical skills
Many careers,such as law and medicine,require extended,precise analysis.Each
chapter offers practice in following a sustained and closely argued line of thought.
That mathematics can develop this skill is shown by these two testimonials:

## G

A physician wrote,'The discipline of analytical thought processes [in mathematics]
prepared me extremely well for medical school. In medicine one is faced with a
problem which must be thoroughly analyzed before a solution can be found. The
process is similar to doing mathematics.'

A lawyer made the same point,'Although I had no background in law - not even
one political science course - I did well at one of the best law schools. I _attribute_
much of my success there to having learned, through the study of mathematics, 
and, **in particular**, theorems, how to analyze complicated principles. Lawyers who
have studied mathematics can master the legal principles in a way that most others
cannot.'

    同义替换：ascribe to：把...归因于；认为...是
    
    in particular：特别是，尤其是    

I hope you will share my _delight_ in watching as simple, even naive, questions
lead to _remarkable_ solutions and purely theoretical discoveries find _unanticipated_
applications.

??? note "note"

    delight：v.n.（使）高兴

    remark：n.言论，评论；引人注目；v.谈论  
    remarkable：adj.引人注目的，非凡的

    unanticipated：adj.意料之外的  
    anticipate：v.预料，期望；在期限内履行（义务），偿还（债务）
