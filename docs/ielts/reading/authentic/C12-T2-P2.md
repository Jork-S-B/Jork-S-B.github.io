# The Lost City

An explorer's _encounter_ with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, the most famous icon of the Inca civilisation

    encounter：v.n.遭遇；偶遇，邂逅

## A

When the US explorer and academic Hiram Bingham arrived in South America in
1911 , he was ready for what was to be the greatest achievement of his life: the
exploration of the remote _hinterland_ to the west of Cusco, the old capital of the Inca
empire in the Andes mountains of Peru. His goal was to locate the remains of a city
called Vitcos, the last capital of the Inca civilisation. Cusco lies on a high plateau
at an _elevation_ of more than 3,000 metres, and Bingham's plan was to descend
from this plateau along the valley of the Urubamba river, which takes a _circuitous_
route down to the Amazon and passes through an area of dramatic canyons and
mountain ranges.

    elevation：n.高度，海拔

    circuitous：adj.迂绕的

## B

When Bingham and his team **set off** down the Urubamba in late July, they had
an advantage over travellers who had _preceded_ them: _a track had recently been
blasted down the valley canyon to enable rubber to be brought up by mules from
the jungle._ Almost all previous travellers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and
taken a high pass across the mountains to rejoin the rive lower down, thereby
cutting a _substantial_ corner, but also therefore never passing through the area
around Machu Picchu.

## C

On 24 July they were a few days into their _descent_ of the valley. The day began
slowly, with Bingham trying to arrange sufficient mules for the next stage of the
trek. His companions showed no interest in accompanying him up the nearby hill
to see some ruins that a local farmer, Melchor Arteaga, had told them about the
night before. The morning was dull and damp, and Bingham also **seems to have
been less than keen on** the prospect of climbing the hill. In his book Lost City of the
Incas, he relates that he **made the ascent** without having **the least expectation** that
he would find anything at the top.

## D

Bingham writes about the approach in vivid style in his book. First, as he climbs
up the hill, he describes the ever-present possibility of deadly snakes,'capable of
making considerable springs when in pursuit of their prey'; not that he sees any.
Then there's a sense of mounting discovery as he comes ac oss eat sweeps
of te races then a mausoleum, followed by _monumental_ staircases and, finally,
the grand ceremonial buildings of Machu Picchu.'It seemed like an unbelievable
dream ... the sight held me spellbound ...' he wrote.

## E

We should remember however, that Lost City of the Incas is **a work of hindsight**,
not written until 1948, many years after his journey. **His _journal_ entries of the
time reveal a much more gradual appreciation of his achievement.** He spent
the afternoon at the ruins noting down the dimensions of some of the buildings,
then descended and rejoined his companions, to whom he seems to have said
little about his discovery. At this stage, Bingham didn't realise the extent or the
importance of the site, nor did he realise what use he could make of the discovery.

    journey：n.v.旅行

## F

However, soon after returning it **occurred to him** that he could make a name for
himself from this discovery. When he came to write the National Geographic
magazine article that **broke the story to the world** in April 1913, he knew he had
to produce a big idea. He wondered whether it could have been the birthplace of
the very first Inca, Manco the Great, and whether it could also have been what
chroniclers described as 'the last city of the Incas'. This term refers to Vilcabamba,
the settlement where the Incas had fled from Spanish invade in the 1530s.
Bingham **made desperate attempts to** prove this belief for nearly 40 years. Sadly,
his vision of the site as both the beginning and end of the Inca civilisation, while
a magnificent one, is inaccurate. We now know that Vilcabamba actually lies 65
kilometres away in the depths of the jungle.

    occurred to him：他突然想到

    make desperate attempts to：孤注一掷，不顾一切

## G

One question that has _perplexed_ visitors, historians and archaeologists alike ever
since Bingham, is why the site seems to have been abandoned before the Spanish
Conquest. There are no references to it by any of the Spanish _chroniclers_ - and if
they had known of its existence so close to Cusco they would certainly have come
in search of gold. An idea which has gained wide acceptance ove the past few
yea sis that Machu Picchu was a moya, a country estate built by an Inca emperor
to escape the cold winters of Cusco, where the _elite_ could enjoy monumental
architecture and spectacular views Furthermore, the particular architecture of
Machu Picchu suggests that it was constructed at the time of the greatest of all the
Incas, the emperor Pachacuti (c. 1438-71). **By custom**, Pachacuti's _descendants_
built other similar estates for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been
abandoned after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish Conquest.
