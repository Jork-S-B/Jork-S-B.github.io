Tell me about yourself. Four simple words that can make anyone **ramble or freeze**.

Even people at the top of their game can go blank when they hear those **dreaded** words. So what does that mean?

    ramble or freeze：语无伦次或大脑一片空白  
    ramble：v.散步；闲聊；随笔；adj.絮絮叨叨  
    freeze：v.n.冻结；呆住
    
    dreaded：adj.令人畏惧的

Does your introduction really make that big of a difference? I never thought it did.

I thought my introduction wasn't nearly as important as my qualifications. For example,
right after I started my business, I had the perfect opportunity to shine.

I was interviewing as an _instructor_ for Supply Chain _Institute_, and I knew I was the ideal _candidate_.

??? note "笔记"

    instructor：n.讲师
    
    institute：n.机构；协会；研究所；v.制定（规则）；任命

    candidate：n.候选人

I had over 20 years of expertise leading supply chains for one of the world's largest
consumer products companies.

As a _prep_ for my interview, I didn't want there to be any doubts about my qualifications.

I created an **elevator pitch** and included a complete list of my accomplishments.

??? note "笔记"

    prep：n.（非正式）`preparation`的缩写

    elevator pitch：电梯游说，即简洁的语言讲述自己的商业计划、个人优势等

When I heard "Tell me about yourself," I was ready, and I proudly explained everything that I could do.

When I finished, the interviewer said, "Instead of talking about yourself, it would have been
more effective if you had explained what you can do for me."

My interview lasted five minutes. **She rejected me on the spot based off of one answer.** That was my **wake-up call**.

??? note "笔记"
    
    on the spot：当场，立即  
    based off of：非正式，等同于`base on`  
    标准形式：She rejected me on the spot based on just one answer.
    
    wake-up call：当头棒喝

I realized it doesn't matter how smart you are, it doesn't matter how perfect a fit you are, if
you can't capture someone's attention.

After that, I became **laser-focused on** cracking the code on introducing myself.

I studied the science of first impressions. I researched **viral headlines** and what made them so **irresistible**.

And then, I discovered the secret of introducing myself perfectly in 20 words or less. **Fast-forward** about six months.

??? note "笔记"

    laser：n.v.镭射激光  
    laser-focused on：指全神贯注，像激光一样集中

    viral headlines：爆款标题  
    viral：adj.病毒性的；病毒式营销的；n.爆款

    irresistible：adj.难以抵抗的

    fast-forward：快进

I'm having coffee with the executive director of a business-development program.

She asks me, "What do you do?" I answer her in one sentence: "I'm a communications
consultant and I help people with something to say but struggle to say it."

She **leans in** and says three magic words. "Tell me more." Fifteen minutes later, she hires me
to give **workshops** for new entrepreneurs.

??? note "笔记"

    leans in：向...倾斜；进一步

    workshop：n.研讨会，培训；车间，工坊

But here's the thing. I was the same person who blew that interview just six months before.

But this time, I got the job, even though I had way fewer qualifications and the only thing
different between success and failure,

Between that door of opportunity opening or slamming shut in my face, was my introduction.

From that point on, I started to see my introduction **in a whole new light**. It wasn't just a way
of grabbing someone's attention.

I thought about all those times when I would hear "no," and my **inner critic** would tell me
that people didn't see me or hear me because I wasn't good enough or smart enough.

??? note "笔记"

    in a whole new light：从全新的角度

    inner critic：自我评判

But that was wrong. It wasn't me. It was my introduction. Alright, are you ready to introduce
yourself in 20 words or less?

I'm going to start with two secrets of getting people to say "tell me more." Secret number one: 
**Think sound bite, not data dump.**

That's because with today's multitasking **attention-deficit** audiences, it's been said you have
a better chance of **engaging with** a goldfish than the person that you're talking to.

??? note "笔记"

    Think sound bite, not data dump.  
    言简意赅，不要长篇大论。

    deficit：n.亏损，不足，缺乏

    engage with：与...接触，与...互动

A 20-word introduction is designed to grab someone's attention and get them to say "tell me more."

Secret number two. Do you remember what that interviewer told me? "Don't talk about
yourself." Instead, explain what you can do for them.

I call it the difference between an "about-me" **versus** an "about-you" introduction.

??? note "笔记"

    versus：prep.以...为对手；与...相比

An about-me introduction sounds like this: "I'm an award-winning, best-selling author."

Compare that to "I help new authors get published faster." Can you hear the difference?

One describes me, the other describes what I can do for you.

Now that you know the secrets, here are five ways to introduce yourself perfectly in 20 words or less.

I'm going to start with a straightforward about-you introduction. The formula is "I help my
target audience achieve a benefit they desire."

For example, "I help worried job hunters confidently explain why they're the ideal candidate
to hire." Now, here's a tip about your "benefit."

A benefit answers your listeners' question "How will my life be different?"

For the second framework, let's **go beyond** offering a benefit. Let's promise a breakthrough.

??? note "笔记"

    go beyond：超越

The formula is the same as the benefit one, but you're going to add the word "without".

"I help my target audience achieve a benefit they desire without negative consequence."

"I help establish brands in competitive markets, rapidly reach new audiences without
increasing marketing spend."

The word "without" is so powerful because that's how you explain what makes you unique.

For the last three frameworks, here's what to say if you don't want to focus on your career.

For example, you're mission-driven, or you're on a **career pivot**.

??? note "笔记"
    
    career pivot：职业转向  
    pivot：n.核心，支点；v.旋转

Maybe you're a student and you don't have a lot of work experience. In this case, you can
use your passion, your mission or your strength.

I'll start with your passion. "I'm passionate about something I **value** to achieve something
my target audience values."

??? note "笔记"

    value：n.价值；v.看重

"I'm passionate about helping people in need and creating opportunities that change lives."

Next, instead of your passion, you can use your strength.

"I'm known for my strength to achieve something my target audience values." 

"I'm known for my **critical thinking** and turning information into **actionable insights**."

??? note "笔记"
    
    critical thinking：批判性思维
    
    actionable insights：可执行的洞察

Last, you can use your mission. "I'm on a mission to -- to achieve something my target audience values."

"I'm on a mission to **bridge the healthcare divide** and make a lasting difference for vulnerable communities."

??? note "笔记"

    bridge the healthcare divide：弥合医疗鸿沟

And that's how you use your passion, your mission or your strength. Now that you've seen
the five introductions, your next step -- try them out.

Don't be surprised if you find yourself using more than one. That's because different
audiences value different things, so what works for one may not work for another.

But that's OK. You'll see there are multiple ways of getting people to say "tell me more."

I'll **close with this thought**: Have doors been closed in your face? Do you struggle to be seen and heard?

Does your inner critic tell you you're not good enough or smart enough, or that you're an **imposter** 
and something is way above your pay grade?

??? note "笔记"

    close with this thought：以这个想法作为结束

    imposter：n.骗子，冒名顶替者
    
    something is way above your pay grade：超出某人的职权/责任范围  
    far beyond your ability：超出某人的个人能力

Before you **buy into** your **inner critic's narrative**, let me challenge you. What if?

??? note "笔记"
     
    buy into：接受，相信；购买

    inner critic's narrative：自我批判的叙述  
    narrative：n.记叙文；adj，叙述的

What if that voice inside your head is wrong? What if you are good enough and smart
enough? What if the best way to describe you is "impressive"?

Not "imposter." And what if the only thing between you and being seen, heard and recognized 
is your introduction in 20 words.

    1.Benefit - the formula is "I help my target audience achieve a benefit they desire".
    
    2.Without - I help my target audience achieve their goal without any loss or increasing expense.
