Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of Thor Heyerdahl?

??? note "note"

    我们的演讲能不能以Thor Heyerdahl的早期生活为开头?

Sure. Why don't you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially his passion for collecting things?

That's right, he had his own little museum.

And I think it's unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents' hobbies;

I'm thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn't go hunting with his dad, for example.

Yeah, he **preferred** to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him.

And quite **early on** he knew he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up.

??? note "note"

    而且他很早就知道自己长大之后想要成为一名探险家。
    
    early on：在早期

That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think...

No, it was climbing that he spent his time **on** as a young man. Oh, right...

After university he married a classmate and together, they decided to experience living on a small island, 
to find out how harsh weather conditions shaped people's lifestyles.

??? note "note"

    大学毕业之后，他和同班的一个女生结了婚，然后他们俩共同决定体验一下居住在小岛上的感受，去弄清楚严酷的天气条件对人们的生活方式会有哪些影响。
    
    harsh weather conditions  
    同义替换：extreme environment

**As part of their preparation** before they left home, they **learnt** basic survival skills like building a shelter.

??? note "note"

    他们离开家之前，做的准备工作的一部分就是学习一些基本的生存技能，比如建造一个住所。

    learnt：`learn`的过去式和过去分词（英式）
    learned：adj.博学的；v.`learn`的过去式和过去分词（美式）

I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut off by the sea, 
which is what they were **aiming to** do.

??? note "note"

    我想他们要在一个人迹罕至的荒岛上生存的话，这种知识是必需的，而生活在那种地方也正是他们的目的所在。

An important part of your talk should be the _radical_ theory Heyerdahl formed from examining mysterious ancient
carvings that he happened to find on the island.

??? note "note"

    你的演讲中应该包括的一个重要部分，就是Heverdahl通过研究他无意中在荒岛上发现的神秘的古代石雕而形成的激进理论。

    radical  
    adj.激进的，彻底的；（增减）急剧的，大幅度的；（数）根式的，根号的；词根的；（植）根生的；
    n. 激进分子；游离基，自由基；词根；（汉字）偏旁，部首；（数）根式；根号

I think you should finish with that. OK.
