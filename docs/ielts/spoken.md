Well, there's a versatile musician I admire, who I met at a youth hostel during my trip to Shangri-La. His performances 
turned the common area into an intimate concert space, spontaneously creating an instant bond among strangers. 
I'm inspired by his dedication and commitment to music, which began a decade ago when he was busking on the streets of Shangri-La.

He's kind, expressive and always willing to lend a helping hand. He's also knowledgeable and experienced, 
and I've learned a great deal from him about the world and life in general. Hopefully I can remain as diligent and 
passionate in my career as he is.
