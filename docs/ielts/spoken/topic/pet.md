## 📌 Pets and Animals

1.Do you like animals?

_Yes, I do. I wouldn't say I'm a huge animal lover, but I generally enjoy being around animals. 
They make people feel more relaxed, and sometimes just watching them can be quite comforting, 
especially after a long day._

2.What's your favourite animal?

_My favourite animal is probably dogs. What I like most about dogs is that they're very loyal and easy to connect with.
They seem to understand human emotions quite well, and being with a dog usually **puts me in a better mood**._

3.Did you want to keep a pet when you were young?

_Yes, I did. When I was young, I really wanted to have a pet, especially a dog. 
However, my parents were quite busy, and they didn't think we had enough time or energy to 
take **proper** care of an animal, so it never really happened._
