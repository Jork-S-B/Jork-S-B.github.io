## Creativity

1.What can we do to help children keep creative?

_Well, we can let them play freely instead of setting too many rules. Let them draw, **build things with blocks** or 
tell stories. Also, we shouldn't **judge their ideas** as "silly" — that stops creativity. Encouraging them to try 
mew things is the best way, I think._

* Exposure to different cultures can encourage creativity. 接触不同的文化可以激发创造力；"Exposure to"强调长期浸润式接触。

2.What kind of jobs require creativity?

_Lots of jobs do. Like designers—they need to **make new and cool stuff**. Teachers also need creativity to make classes fun 
for students. And artists, of course — painters, writers, musicians, they all create **original work** every day. These jobs 
can’t be done well without creativity._
