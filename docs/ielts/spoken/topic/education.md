## Creativity

1.What can we do to help children keep creative?

Well, we can let them play freely instead of setting too many rules. Let them draw, **build things with blocks** or 
tell stories. Also, we shouldn't **judge their ideas** as "silly"—that stops creativity. Encouraging them to try 
mew things is the best way, I think.

2.What kind of jobs require creativity?

Lots of jobs do. Like designers—they need to **make new and cool stuff**. Teachers also need creativity to make classes fun 
for students. And artists, of course—painters, writers, musicians, they all create **original work** every day. These jobs 
can’t be done well without creativity
