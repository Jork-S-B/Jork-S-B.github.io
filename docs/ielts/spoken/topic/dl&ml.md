1.What time do you usually wake up?

I take my time and sleep in till 10:00 A.M to catch up on any lost sleep._

2.Do you prefer mornings or evenings?

_I really enjoy the evening time because it is the time that I leave work and go back homne and can relax all by myself.
During the evenings I am free to plan to do whether I want and never leave any pending work so that I can enjoy myself._

3.Do you prefer staying at home or going out in your free time?

_I prefer staying at home on sundays, the reason being that I usually spend the whole day and night outside on friday's
