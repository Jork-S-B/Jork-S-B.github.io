## 📌 Daily life and modern life

### 🚁 Part 1

1.What time do you usually wake up?

_I usually wake up at 7:00 A.M on weekdays so that I can reach my workplace on time. However during the weekends
I take my time and sleep in till 10:00 A.M to catch up on any lost sleep.

2.Do you prefer mornings or evenings?

_I really enjoy the evening time because it is the time that I leave work and go back homne and can relax all by myself.
During the evenings I am free to plan to do whether I want and never leave any pending work so that I can enjoy myself._

3.Do you prefer staying at home or going out in your free time?

_I prefer staying at home on sundays, the reason being that I usually spend the whole day and night outside on friday's 
and saturdays. So I make sure that I stay home on sundays to rest and recharge before the weekdays._

## 📌 Day off

1.When was the last time you had a few days off?

_The last time I had a few days off was a couple of months ago, during a short holiday. I didn't travel very far. 
Most of the time, I just stayed at home and tried to slow down a bit. I **caught up on sleep**, watched some shows, 
and basically took a break from my **usual routine**._

2.Do you usually spend your days off with your parents or with your friends?

_It really depends on the situation. If it's a longer break, I tend to spend more time with my parents because **we don't 
get to see each other very often**. But if it's just a single day off, I usually **meet up with** friends, maybe **grab a meal** 
together or just hang out and chat._

3.What would you like to do if you had a day off tomorrow?

_If I had a day off tomorrow, I'd probably keep things simple. I'd like to **sleep in（睡懒觉）**, go out for a nice meal, 
and maybe take a walk to clear my head. I wouldn't plan anything **too packed**. For me, a good day off is more about 
relaxing and recharging than doing something special._
