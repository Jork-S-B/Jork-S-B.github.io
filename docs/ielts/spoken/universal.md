Well, there's a versatile singer I admire, who I met at a youth hostel during my trip to Shangri-La. His performances
turned the common area into an intimate concert space, spontaneously creating an instant bond among strangers.
I'm inspired by his dedication and commitment to music, which began a decade ago when he was busking on the streets of
Shangri-La.

He's kind, expressive and always willing to lend a helping hand. He's also knowledgeable and experienced,
and I've **learned a great deal** from him about the world and life in general. Hopefully I can remain as diligent and
passionate in my career as he is.
