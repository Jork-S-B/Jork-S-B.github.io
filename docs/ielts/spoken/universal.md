Well, there's a versatile musician I admire, who I met at a youth hostel during my trip to Shangri-La. His performances
turned the common area into an intimate concert space, spontaneously creating an instant bond among strangers.
I'm inspired by his dedication and commitment to music, which began a decade ago when he was busking on the streets of
Shangri-La.

He's kind, expressive and always willing to lend a helping hand. He's also knowledgeable and experienced,
and I've **learned a great deal** from him about the world and life in general. Hopefully I can remain as diligent and
passionate in my career as he is.

Lijiang tends to attract a lot of people because it's a famous tourist city. In fact, when you see the snow mountain in
Lijiang, what you sense is enormous {todo, senceic}. 

It is one of the most dynamic and relax cities in the world. There are new traveler visit the city, form all over the world,
almost every day.
{使用从句，合理通顺的合并一下}
It's quite more laid-back than big cities in China, like Guangzhou or Shanghai. For me, life seems to move slower in Lijiang
that/spontaneously {todo，非常适合度假}

One thing I love the most about Lijiang is 很多民谣歌手. They are very extrovert and friendly, very willing to 用音乐调节氛围
among strangers. Last time when I was there, I had a great time.
